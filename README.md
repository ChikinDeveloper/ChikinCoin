# ChikinCoin


Disrupting the chicken society through decentralization.

ChikinCoin is run by a team of innovative but not very trusted chicken developers. Randomness is our n°1 priority, (to feed is n°2).

## Introduction

There are 25.9 billion chickens (in 2019) alive in the world, and yet none of them have access to basic financial services. How can a chicken start saving for a better future under such conditions ?

Decentralization and tokenization has a lot to offer to the chicken society, and is an awesome way for us to become again the mighty dinosaurs we used to be.
